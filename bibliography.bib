abstract = {{Background Most of the in vivo neurovascular imaging studies are performed in anesthetized animals. However, anesthesia significantly affects cerebral hemodynamics. New method We applied optical coherence tomography (OCT) methods such as optical microangiography (OMAG) and Doppler optical microangiography (DOMAG) to quantitatively evaluate the effect of anesthesia in cerebral vasculature and blood flow in mouse brain. Results The OMAG results indicated the increase of large vessel diameter and capillary density induced by ketamine-xylazine and isoflurane, meaning that both anesthetics caused vasodilation. In addition, the preliminary results from DOMAG showed that isoflurane increased the baseline cerebral blood flow. Comparison with existing methods In comparison with other in vivo imaging modalities, OCT can provide label-free assessment of cortical tissue including tissue morphology, cerebral blood vessel network and flow information down to capillary level, with a large field of view and high imaging speed. Conclusions OCT angiography methods demonstrated the ability to measure the differences in the baseline morphological and flow parameters of both large and capillary cerebrovascular networks between awake and anesthetized mice.}},

Here, we use a multimodal neural platform in a mouse model of stroke and realize long-term, spatially resolved tracking of intracortical neural activity and cerebral blood flow in the same brain regions. We observe a pronounced neurovascular dissociation that occurs immediately after small-scale strokes, becomes the most severe a few days after, lasts into chronic periods, and varies with the level of ischemia. Neuronal deficits extend spatiotemporally, whereas restoration of cerebral blood flow occurs sooner and reaches a higher relative value. Our findings reveal the neurovascular impact of ministrokes and inform the limitation of neuroimaging techniques that infer neural activity from hemodynamic responses.}},

A translatable animal model that closely mimics the mechanisms of a human stroke is essential in understanding recovery processes as well as developing therapies that improve functional outcomes. We describe a photothrombosis stroke model that is capable of targeting a single distal pial branch of the middle cerebral artery with minimal damage to the surrounding parenchyma in awake head-fixed mice. Mice are implanted with chronic cranial windows above one hemisphere of the brain that allow optical access to study recovery mechanisms for over a month following occlusion. Additionally, we study the effect of laser spot size used for occlusion and demonstrate that a spot size with small axial and lateral resolution has the advantage of minimizing unwanted photodamage while still monitoring macroscopic changes to cerebral blood flow during photothrombosis. We show that temporally guiding illumination using real-time feedback of blood flow dynamics also minimized unwanted photodamage to the vascular network. Finally, through quantifiable behavior deficits and chronic imaging we show that this model can be used to study recovery mechanisms or the effects of therapeutics longitudinally.}},

Since it is difficult to ensure that an animal is in a truly resting state while awake, RSFC measurements under anesthesia remain an important approach. Therefore, we systematically examined measures of RSFC using non-invasive, widefield optical intrinsic signal imaging under five different anesthetics in male C57BL/6J mice. We find excellent seed-based, global, and interhemispheric connectivity using tribromoethanol (Avertin) and ketamine-xylazine, comparable to results in the literature including awake animals. Urethane anesthesia yielded intermediate results, while chloral hydrate and isoflurane were both associated with poor RSFC. Furthermore, we found a correspondence between the strength of RSFC and the power of low-frequency hemodynamic fluctuations. In conclusion, Avertin and ketamine-xylazine provide robust and reproducible measures of RSFC in mice, whereas chloral hydrate and isoflurane do not.}},

Although it has been reported as safe, recent findings suggest that despite widespread use, isoflurane‐induced inhalational anesthesia can lead to various pathophysiological and cognitive alterations. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the long‐term behavioral and white matter consequences of repeated isoflurane exposure. Twenty 3‐month‐old C57BL/6J male mice received one exposure of isoflurane for 40 min or 2 exposures to isoflurane separated by 3 days. Behavioral paradigms (open field, balance beam, foot fault, rotarod, elevated zero maze, tail suspension, water maze, and social recognition tests) were administered at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 90 days post exposure. Animals exposed to repeated isoflurane showed significant motor deficits on the balance beam and increased anxiety‐like behavior. Animals exposed to single isoflurane showed impaired performance on the foot fault test. Diffusion tensor imaging showed that repeated isoflurane exposure led to long‐term disruption of water diffusivity in corpus callosum (CC) white matter. Furthermore, 2‐D structure‐tensor analysis from stained brain sections showed differences in the microstructural organization of CC white matter in mice with single versus repeated isoflurane exposures. These results suggest that behavioral deficits observed up to 90 days after repeated isoflurane exposure resulted from, at least in part, altered CC white matter microstructural integrity. We report that repeated isoflurance exposure can lead to persistent motor impairments and long‐term alteration in white matter microstructural organization in mice.}},

Here, we review work showing that neurovascular coupling and brain circuit function in the awake animal are profoundly different from those in the anesthetized state. We argue that the time is right to study neurovascular coupling and brain circuit function in the awake animal to bridge the physiological mechanisms that underlie animal and human neuroimaging signals, and to interpret them in light of underlying neural mechanisms.

Our protocol does not require any surgical steps at the time of stroke induction or anesthetics during either head fixation or photoactivation. In addition, we performed laser speckle contrast imaging and wide-field calcium imaging to reveal the effect of cortical spreading ischemic depolarization after stroke in both anesthetized and awake animals over a spatial scale encompassing both hemispheres. With our combined approach, we observed ischemic depolarizing waves (3 to 5 mm/min) propagating across the cortex 1 to 5 min after stroke induction in genetically encoded calcium indicator mice. Measures of blood flow by laser speckle were correlated with neurological impairment and lesion volume, suggesting a metric for reducing experimental variability. The ability to follow brain dynamics immediately after stroke as well as during recovery may provide a valuable guide to develop activity-dependent therapeutic interventions to be performed shortly after stroke induction.}},

In the present study, we examined whether isoflurane anesthesia produces long-term pathophysiological alterations in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain region that plays a central role in emotional behavior. Ten-week-old, male rats were administered either a single, 1 h long isoflurane (1.5\%) anesthesia or three, 1 h long isoflurane exposures, separated by 48 h. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and spontaneous GABAergic activity in the BLA were studied 1 day, 1 week, and 1 month later. Single isoflurane anesthesia had no significant effect on the magnitude of LTP. In contrast, after repeated isoflurane exposures, LTP was dramatically impaired at both 1 day and 1 week after the last exposure but was restored by 1 month after the exposures. Spontaneous GABAA receptor-mediated IPSCs were increased at 1 day and 1 week after repeated exposures but had returned to control levels by 1 month after exposure. Thus, repeated exposures to isoflurane cause a long-lasting-but not permanent-impairment of synaptic plasticity in the BLA, which could be due to increased basal GABAergic activity. These pathophysiological alterations may produce emotional disturbances and impaired fear-related learning.}},

By revisiting the governing dynamic light scattering models, we test the ability to predict the degree of multiple dynamic scattering across vessels in order to correct for the observed discrepancies between relative RBC speeds and multi-exposure speckle imaging estimates of inverse correlation times. The analysis reveals that traditional speckle contrast imagery of vascular flows is neither a measure of volumetric flux nor particle speed, but rather the product of speed and vessel diameter. The corrected speckle estimates of the relative RBC speeds have an average 10 ± 3\% deviation in vivo with those obtained from RBC tracking.}},

Simultaneous fMRI and electrophysiology were used to measure changes in single units (SU), multi-unit activity (MUA), local field potentials (LFP), and the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response in the somatosensory cortex during whisker stimulation of rabbits before, during and after anesthesia with fentanyl or isoflurane. Our results indicate that anesthesia modulates the BOLD signal as well as both baseline and stimulus-evoked neuronal activity, and, most significantly, that the relationship between the BOLD and electrophysiological signals depends on the type of anesthetic. Specifically, the behavior of LFP observed under isoflurane did not parallel the behavior of BOLD, SU, or MUA. These findings suggest that the relationship between these signals may not be straightforward.

To address this issue, we developed a protocol for inducing photothrombotic occlusion of cerebral vessels in fully conscious mice and tested two potential neuroprotectant drugs (a GluN2B or α4β2 nicotinic receptor antagonist). Our data show in vehicle treated mice that just 20 min of exposure to isoflurane during stroke induction can significantly reduce ischemic cortical damage relative to mice that were awake during stroke. When comparing potential stroke therapies, none provided any level of neuroprotection if the stroke was induced with anesthesia. However, if mice were fully conscious during stroke, the α4β2 nicotinic receptor antagonist reduced ischemic damage by 23\% relative to vehicle treated controls, whereas the GluN2B antagonist had no significant effect.

This study is designed to determine whether isoflurane postconditioning improves long-term neurological outcome after focal brain ischemia and whether this protection is mediated by attenuating neuroinflammation. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to a 90-min middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO). Isoflurane postconditioning was performed by exposing rats to 2\% isoflurane for 60min immediately after the MCAO. Isoflurane postconditioning reduced brain infarct volumes, apoptotic cells in the ischemic penumbral brain tissues and neurological deficits of rats at 4weeks after the MCAO. Isoflurane postconditioning reduced brain ischemia/reperfusion-induced nuclear transcription factor (NF)-κB (NF-κB) activation as well as interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-6 production in the ischemic penumbral brain tissues at 24h after the MCAO. IL-1β deficient mice had smaller brain infarct volumes and better neurological functions than wild-type mice at 24h after a 90-min focal brain ischemia. Isoflurane posttreatment failed to induce neuroprotection in the IL-1β deficient mice. Our results suggest that isoflurane postconditioning improved long-term neurological outcome after transient focal brain ischemia. This protection may be mediated by inhibiting NF-κB activation and the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β.}},

To investigate this relationship, we used optical imaging in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Hemodynamic responses yielded clear maps of retinotopy in both anesthetized and awake mice. However, during wakefulness, responses were four times larger and twice as fast. These differences held whether we induced anesthesia with urethane or isoflurane and whether awake mice were stationary or running on a treadmill. With electrode recordings, we established that the effects of wakefulness reflect changes in neurovascular coupling, not in neural activity. By activating V1 directly via optogenetics, we replicated the effects of wakefulness in terms of timing but not of amplitude. We conclude that neurovascular coupling depends critically on anesthesia and wakefulness: during wakefulness, neural activity is followed by much stronger and quicker hemodynamic responses.}},

Although techniques such as Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) have emerged as valuable tools for imaging CBF in acute experiments, their utility for chronic measurements or cross-animal comparisons has been limited. Recently, an extension to LSCI called Multi-Exposure Speckle Imaging (MESI) was introduced that increases the quantitative accuracy of CBF images. In this paper, we show that estimates of chronic blood flow are better with MESI than with traditional LSCI. We evaluate the accuracy of the MESI flow estimates using red blood cell (RBC) photographic tracking as an absolute flow calibration in mice over several days. The flow measures computed using the MESI and LSCI techniques were found to be on average 10\% and 24\% deviant (n 1⁄4 9 mice), respectively, compared with RBC velocity changes. We also map CBF dynamics after photo-thrombosis of selected cortical microvasculature. Correlations of flow dynamics with RBC tracking were closer with MESI (r 1⁄4 0.88) than with LSCI (r 1⁄4 0.65) up to 2 weeks from baseline. With the increased quantitative accuracy, MESI can provide a platform for studying the efficacy of stroke therapies aimed at flow restoration.}},

Changes in CBF, red blood cell (RBC) velocity and concentration in the somatosensory cortex to whisker stimulation were measured using laser-Doppler flowmetry in awake and anesthetized mice. The increase in the rate of RBC velocity change observed during whisker stimulation was far greater than the increase in the rate of RBC concentration change under the awake condition. During the resting condition, significant differences in baseline CBF, RBC velocity and concentration between awake and anesthesia mice were not observed. Isoflurane-induced anesthesia attenuated the increase in RBC velocity and concentration during stimulation, with the attenuation of the RBC velocity increase being greater than that of RBC concentration. The RBC measurement techniques in awake animals should lead to much better understanding of the hemodynamic system evoked by neural activity.}},

Here, we review the effects of anesthesia on the spatial propagation, temporal dynamics, and quantitative relationship between the neural and vascular responses to cortical stimulation. Previous studies have shown that the onset latency of evoked cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes is relatively consistent across anesthesia conditions compared with variations in the time-to-peak. This finding indicates that the mechanism of vasodilation onset is less dependent on anesthesia interference, while vasodilation dynamics are subject to this interference. The quantitative coupling relationship is largely influenced by the type and dosage of anesthesia, including the actions on neural processing, vasoactive signal transmission, and vascular reactivity. The effects of anesthesia on the spatial gap between the neural and vascular response regions are not fully understood and require further attention to elucidate the mechanism of vascular control of CBF supply to the underlying focal and surrounding neural activity. The in-depth understanding of the anesthesia actions on neurovascular elements allows for better decision-making regarding the anesthetics used in specific models for neurovascular experiments and may also help elucidate the signal source issues in hemodynamic-based neuroimaging techniques.}},

The animal was placed on an air float ball that allowed the animal to walk, while the head of the animal was fixed in a custom-made stereotactic apparatus. Dynamic CBF changes in the barrel cortex and animal locomotion were simultaneously monitored with laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) and an optical motion sensor that detected the rotation distance of the ball, respectively. Whisker stimulation-induced CBF measured under daytime and nighttime conditions showed consistent responses (24\% and 23\% of the pre-stimulus baseline, respectively), whereas the amount of locomotion was 1.4 times higher during nighttime relative to daytime. Repeated longitudinal experiments over 7 days showed a reproducible, evoked CBF (13-26\% relative to the baseline among 7 animals). The mean of the variance coefficient (i.e., standard deviation divided by mean) across multiple days was 0.11 and 0.75 for evoked CBF and locomotion, respectively. These results showed reproducible and reliable measurements of longitudinal CBF response in behaving mice regardless of day-to-day variations in locomotion. Furthermore, we confirmed that the CBF response to whisker stimulation was well localized and reproducible, measured with laser speckle imaging under awake condition. The results further show the capability of long-term hemodynamic imaging in normal and disease-model mice, which is of particular importance for understanding the longitudinal changes and plasticity of neurovascular coupling and behavioral performances such as during growth, development and aging.}},

The ability to map the functional connectivity of distributed circuits, and to assess how this connectivity evolves over time, will be facilitated by methods for characterizing the network impact of activating a specific subcircuit, cell type, or projection pathway. We describe here an approach using high-resolution blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) of the awake mouse brain-to measure the distributed BOLD response evoked by optical activation of a local, defined cell class expressing the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). The utility of this opto-fMRI approach was explored by identifying known cortical and subcortical targets of pyramidal cells of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and by analyzing how the set of regions recruited by optogenetically driven SI activity differs between the awake and anesthetized states. Results showed positive BOLD responses in a distributed network that included secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), primary motor cortex (MI), caudoputamen (CP), and contralateral SI (c-SI). Measures in awake compared with anesthetized mice (0.7\% isoflurane) showed significantly increased BOLD response in the local region (SI) and indirectly stimulated regions (SII, MI, CP, and c-SI), as well as increased BOLD signal temporal correlations between pairs of regions. These collective results suggest opto-fMRI can provide a controlled means for characterizing the distributed network downstream of a defined cell class in the awake brain. Opto-fMRI may find use in examining causal links between defined circuit elements in diverse behaviors and pathologies.}},

We have therefore developed elastix, a publicly available computer program for intensity-based medical image registration. The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve medical image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application.

In this study, the dose-dependent effects of isoflurane on neurovascular coupling were examined with concurrent recordings of the local field potential (FP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the rat somatosensory cortex. Electrical forepaw stimulation was used, and consisted of either a single pulse or 10 pulses at various frequencies. We observed that the FP response to single-pulse stimulation remained unaffected across the different levels of isoflurane tested (1.1–2.1\%), whereas the CBF response to single-pulse stimulation increased dose-dependently (7 ± 3\% to 17 ± 4\%). The isoflurane dose did not affect the vascular reactivity induced by a hypercapnic challenge. These findings suggest that the action of isoflurane affects the neurovascular mechanisms. For 10-pulse stimulation, the summation of the evoked FP responses monotonically decreased with an increase in the isoflurane dose, possibly due to enhancement of the neural adaptation. In contrast, the dose-dependent effect on the CBF response varied with the stimulus frequency; a dose-dependent decrease in the CBF response was observed for high-frequency stimulation, whereas a dose-dependent increase was observed for low-frequency stimulation. Furthermore, a linear time-invariant model consisting of the single-pulse hemodynamic impulse response convoluted with 10-pulse FP recordings showed that the neurovascular transfer function was altered by the isoflurane dose for high-frequency stimulation. These results indicate that careful and consistent maintenance of the depth of anesthesia is required when comparing fMRI data obtained from different animals or physiological and pharmacological manipulations.}},

The authors examined factors in experimental models potentially critical to definition of enduring isoflurane neuroprotection. Methods: Rats were prepared for temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Pericranial normothermia was maintained. Neurologic deficits (range, 0–48; 0 = no deficit) and cerebral infarct volumes were measured. In experiment 1, rats underwent 50 or 80 min MCAO while awake or anesthetized with 1.8\% isoflurane. Blood pressure was controlled with phenylephrine. Outcome was evaluated 2 weeks later. In experiment 2, rats underwent 50 min MCAO while awake or anesthetized with isoflurane, with outcome evaluated 8 weeks later. In experiment 3, rats underwent 50 min MCAO while awake or anesthetized with isoflurane and 2 weeks recovery. Effects of phenylephrine and the mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate–sensitive K+ channel antagonist 5-hydroxydecanoate were studied. In experiment 4, isoflurane-anesthetized rats underwent 50 min MCAO with permanent or temporary common carotid artery occlusion, with outcome evaluated 2 weeks later. Results: In experiment 1, isoflurane reduced neurologic deficit (median ± interquartile range; awake vs. isoflurane: 11 ± 12 vs. 8 ± 6 for 80 min and 13 ± 4 vs. 3 ± 9 for 50 min; P = 0.0006) and infarct size (160 ± 97 vs. 84 ± 62 mm3 for 80 min and 169 ± 78 vs. 68 ± 61 mm3 for 50 min; P < 0.0001). In experiment 2, isoflurane protection persisted at 8 weeks after ischemia. In experiment 3, there was no effect of phenylephrine or 5-hydroxydecanoate. In experiment 4, permanent common carotid ligation increased infarct size threefold versus temporary occlusion. Conclusions: Isoflurane repeatedly improved long-term neurologic and histologic outcome from focal ischemia independent of ischemia duration, perfusion pressure, or pretreatment with 5-hydroxydecanoate.}},

In four cats anaesthetised with chloralose, the right hemisphere was exposed and the right middle cerebral artery was occluded. The brain was illuminated with a laser diode, the speckle pattern was imaged, and images of inverse speckle correlation time (ICT) were derived from the calculated speckle contrast images. We examined the relationship of ICT with perfusion, as imaged quantitively using umbelliferone clearance (CBFumb). Values of ICT and CBFumb were compared and regression parameters were calculated for each experiment. In eight cats, cortical surface direct current (DC) potential was monitored at two locations and detection of PIDs by DC potential and ICT change was compared. ICT- and CBFumb-derived values of perfusion were closely correlated, with a high degree of significance (P < 0.0001). Overall, monitoring of DC potential detected 90\% of PIDs, whereas ICT detected 56\%. We conclude that (1) laser speckle imaging provides an index of perfusion that has a linear relationship with the clearance rate of umbelliferone within the range of levels of perfusion examined; (2) this relationship is relatively stable between experiments; and (3) the method's ability to detect blood flow changes associated with PIDs likely depends on the noise level of the speckle measurements.}},

When LSF was used to study the response to inhaled CO2 (5\%), the flow increase was similar to the response reported using LDF. For the upper and lower limits of autoregulation, mean arterial pressure values were 110 and 40 mm Hg, respectively. They also show a linear relationship between absolute resting CBF, as determined by [14C]iodoamphetamine technique, and 1/τc values obtained using LSF, and used 1/τc values to compare resting CBF between different animals. Finally, the authors studied CBF changes after distal middle cerebral artery ligation, and developed a model to investigate the spatial distribution and hemodynamics of moderate to severely ischemic cortex.

abstract = {{Anesthetics, widely used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies to avoid movement artifacts, could have profound effects on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular coupling relative to the awake condition. Quantitative CBF and tissue oxygenation (blood oxygen level-dependent [BOLD]) were measured, using the continuous arterial-spin-labeling technique with echo-planar-imaging acquisition, in awake and anesthetized (2\% isoflurane) rats under basal and hypercapnic conditions. All basal blood gases were within physiologic ranges. Blood pressure, respiration, and heart rates were within physiologic ranges in the awake condition but were depressed under anesthesia (P < 0.05). Regional CBF was heterogeneous with whole-brain CBF values of 0.86 +/- 0.25 and 1.27 +/- 0.29 mL. g-1. min-1 under awake and anesthetized conditions, respectively. Surprisingly, CBF was markedly higher (20\% to 70\% across different brain conditions) under isoflurane-anesthetized condition compared with the awake state (P < 0.01). Hypercapnia decreased pH, and increased Pco(2) and Po(2). During 5\% CO(2) challenge, under awake and anesthetized conditions, respectively, CBF increased 51 +/- 11\% and 25 +/- 4\%, and BOLD increased 7.3 +/- 0.7\% and 5.4 +/- 0.4\%. During 10\% CO(2) challenge, CBF increased 158 +/- 28\% and 47 +/- 11\%, and BOLD increased 12.5 +/- 0.9\% and 7.2 +/- 0.5\%. Since CBF and BOLD responses were substantially higher under awake condition whereas blood gases were not statistically different, it was concluded that cerebrovascular reactivity was suppressed by anesthetics. This study also shows that perfusion and perfusion-based functional MRI can be performed in awake animals.}},

Mild hypoxia (17\% O2) during or 5 mg/kg desferrioxiamine administered at the onset of isoflurane pretreatment completely abrogated the development of delayed tolerance (12 h) against focal cerebral ischemia, suggesting that the signaling of delayed protection induced by isoflurane is sensitive to the intracellular oxygenation state.}},

abstract = {{Background Several investigations have shown that volatile anesthetics can reduce ischemic cerebral injury. In these studies, however, neurologic injury was evaluated only after a short recovery period. Recent data suggest that injury caused by ischemia is a dynamic process characterized by continual neuronal loss for a prolonged period. Whether isoflurane-mediated neuroprotection is sustained after a longer recovery period is not known. The current study was conducted to compare the effect of isoflurane on brain injury after short (2-day) and long (14-day) recovery periods in rats subjected to focal ischemia. Methods Fasted Wistar-Kyoto rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and randomly allocated to an awake (n = 36) or an isoflurane (n = 34) group. Animals in both groups were subjected to focal ischemia by filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Pericranial temperature was servocontrolled at 37°C throughout the experiment. In the awake group, isoflurane was discontinued and the animals were allowed to awaken. In the isoflurane group, isoflurane anesthesia was maintained at 1.5 times the minimum alveolar concentration. After 70 min of focal ischemia, the filament was removed. Animals were killed 2 days (awake, n = 18; isoflurane, n = 17) and 14 days (awake, n = 18; isoflurane, n = 17) after ischemia. The volumes of cerebral infarction and selective neuronal necrosis in the animals were determined by image analysis of hematoxylin and eosin–stained coronal brain sections. Results Cortical and subcortical volumes of infarction were significantly less in the isoflurane 2-day group (26 ± 23 mm3 and 17 ± 6 mm3, respectively) than in the awake 2-day group (58 ± 35 mm3, P < 0.01; and 28 ± 12 mm3, P < 0.01, respectively). By contrast, cortical and subcortical volumes of infarction in the awake (41 ± 31 mm3 and 28 ± 16 mm3, respectively) and isoflurane (41 ± 35 mm3 and 19 ± 8 mm3, respectively) 14-day groups were not different (cortex, P = 0.99; subcortex, P = 0.08). The volume of cortical tissue in which selective neuronal necrosis was observed, however, was significantly less in the isoflurane 14-day group (5 ± 4 mm3) than in the awake 14-day group (17 ± 9 mm3, P < 0.01). The total number of necrotic neurons in the region of selective neuronal necrosis was significantly smaller in the isoflurane 14-day group than in the awake 14-day group (P < 0.01). Conclusion Compared with the awake state, isoflurane reduced the extent of infarction assessed 2 days after focal ischemia in rats. At 14 days, however, only selective neuronal necrosis, but not infarction, was reduced by isoflurane. These results suggest that isoflurane delays but does not prevent cerebral infarction caused by focal ischemia. Isoflurane may attenuate the delayed development of selective neuronal necrosis in periinfarct areas in this animal model.}},

abstract = {{Background Activation of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ channels causes cerebral vasodilation. To assess their contribution to volatile anesthetic-induced cerebral vasodilation, the effects of glibenclamide, an adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ channel blocker, on the cerebral vasodilation induced by isoflurane and sevoflurane were studied. Methods Pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs (n = 24) assigned to one of two groups were prepared for measurement of pial vessel diameter using a cranial window preparation. Each dog received three minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC; 0.5, 1, and 1.5 MAC) of either isoflurane or sevoflurane, and the pial arteriolar diameters were measured in the presence or absence of glibenclamide (10-5 M) infused continuously into the window. Mean arterial pressure was maintained with phenylephrine. Furthermore, to assess the direct effect of isoflurane and sevoflurane on cerebral vessels, artificial cerebrospinal fluid was administered topically by being bubbled with isoflurane or sevoflurane. The blocking effect of glibenclamide on the vasoactive effects of these anesthetics also were evaluated. Results Isoflurane and sevoflurane both significantly dilated large (>or= to 100 [micro sign]m) and small (< 100 [micro sign]m) pial arterioles in a concentration-dependent manner (6\% and 10\%, 3\% and 8\% for 0.5 MAC; 10\% and 19\%, 7\% and 14\% for 1 MAC; 17\% and 28\%, 13\% and 25\% for 1.5 MAC). Glibenclamide attenuated the arteriolar dilation induced by these anesthetics (not significant in isoflurane). Topical application of isoflurane or sevoflurane dilated large and small arterioles both in a concentration-dependent manner. Such vasodilation was inhibited completely by glibenclamide. Conclusion The vasodilation of cerebral pial vessels induced by isoflurane and sevoflurane appears to be mediated, at least in part, via activation of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive K+ channels.}},

abstract = {{Isoflurane induces cerebral hyperemia. We sought to assess whether isoflurane induces cerebral microvessel dilation in vivo, and if so, to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium are involved. By using a rat closed cranial window model, pial arterioles and venules of 30-70[mu]m in diameter were measured using intravital microscopy. The cerebral microvascular dilatory response was recorded as percent change of diameter from baseline. The pial vessels were suffused with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) or S-nitroso-acetyl-peni-cillamine (SNAP) to verify intact vascular smooth muscle relaxation function, and with adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and/or acetylcholine (ACh) to verify endothelial NO-generating capability. To isolate NO's role in the cerebral microvascular effects of isoflurane (Protocol I), microvessels were studied with and without nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition by topically applied nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME). In controls, l-NAME was replaced by its inactive enantiomer, nitro-d-arginine methyl ester (d-NAME). Mercury light plus fluorescein dye (LD) endothelial injury (Protocol II) was used to delineate an endothelium-mediated mechanism. Subsequently, vasodilator applications were repeated to verify the desired effects of the interventions and followed by suffusion of isoflurane 1\%, 2\%, and 3\% (Protocol I) or isoflurane 3\% (Protocol II). Suffusions of SNP, ADP, and ACh induced diameter increases of 15\%-30\%. NOS inhibition with l-NAME greatly attenuated ADP and ACh responses, but did not alter the SNP response, confirming that NO generation was blocked, but not NO action. These responses were unaffected in d-NAME-suffused rats. Isoflurane dilated arterioles 17\% and venules 6\% in the presence of d-NAME suffusion. However, after NOS inhibition with l-NAME, the application of isoflurane caused vasoconstriction rather than dilation. Applications of SNAP and ACh significantly increased pial arteriolar diameters. ld endothelial injury, versus dye only, significantly attenuated the ACh response but did not change the SNAP response. The isoflurane response (12\% dilation) was converted to a 5\% vasoconstriction. In summary, isoflurane causes cerebral microvascular dilation in vivo. NO synthesis and endothelium are essential components in this response. (C) 1994 International Anesthesia Research Society}},

We assume that the tissue matrix surrounding the blood cells is a strong diffuser of light and that moving erythrocytes, therefore, are illuminated by a spatially distributed source. Because the surrounding tissue is considered to be stationary, Doppler shifts in the frequency of the scattered light arise only from photon interactions with the moving blood cells. The theory implies that the time decay of the photon autocorrelation function scales proportionally with cell size and inversely with mean translational speed. Analysis of multiple interactions of photons with moving cells indicates the manner in which spectral measurements additionally are sensitive to changes in blood volume. Predictions are verified by measurements of particle flow in model tissues.}},
