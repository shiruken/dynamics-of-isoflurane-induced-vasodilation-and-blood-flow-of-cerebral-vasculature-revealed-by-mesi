# Visualizing anesthesia-induced vasodilation of cerebral vasculature using multi-exposure speckle imaging

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) source code for my paper submitted to the [SPIE](https://spie.org/) journal [_Neurophotonics_](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/neurophotonics) comparing awake and anesthetized cerebral blood flow measurements with multi-exposure speckle imaging (MESI). This work was conducted during my postdoc at the University of Texas at Austin in the [Functional Optical Imaging Laboratory](https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/) ([@UTFOIL](https://github.com/utfoil)).
