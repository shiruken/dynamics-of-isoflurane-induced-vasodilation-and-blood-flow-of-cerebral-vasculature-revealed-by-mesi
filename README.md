# Dynamics of isoflurane-induced vasodilation and blood flow of cerebral vasculature revealed by multi-exposure speckle imaging

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) source code for my paper submitted to the [Journal of Neuroscience Methods](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-neuroscience-methods) comparing awake and anesthetized cerebral blood flow measurements with multi-exposure speckle imaging (MESI). This work was conducted during my postdoc at the University of Texas at Austin in the [Functional Optical Imaging Laboratory](https://foil.bme.utexas.edu/) ([@UTFOIL](https://github.com/utfoil)).

A preprint of this manuscript is available on bioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.26.174227
